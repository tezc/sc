Portable, stand-alone C libraries and data structures. (C99)

Each folder is stand-alone with a single header/source pair in it. There is no  
build for libraries, just copy files you want. 

e.g., If you want the logger, copy sc_log.h and sc_log.c to your project.

#### Features

- High performance & minimal memory usage
- Portability between many operating systems and architectures
- Tests with 100% branch coverage and multiple sanitizers
- Drag & drop source code distribution

#### Q&A

-----
* **Is it any better than library X ?**  
  I often use these libraries for high performance server-side applications. Also,  
  I care about readable and easy to debug code. In summary, these libraries show  
  my taste(trade-offs) about performance/api-design/readability. You may or may  
  not like it.


* **Why don't you change API here at X, so it will be easier to use?**  
  Send a pull request please but be sure you don't introduce an undefined  
  behavior. It's possible to provide better APIs, especially to generic libraries,  
  if you don't care about undefined behaviors. I try to avoid it.


* **What is the most efficient way to use these libraries?**  
  Just like any other code. Add to your project as source files and ideally use   
  -O3 -flto + PGO. It may not make any difference for your use case though.


* **Is library X being used in any product?**  
  Some libraries are used in the production but please always test yourself.


* **Is there any release?**   
  Please use the master branch. It's considered stable.


* **Will you keep API stable?**   
  Please don't expect a stable API. These libraries are quite  
  small (most of them are less than a few hundreds lines of code) and ideally you  
  are supposed to read the code and understand what it does and adapt it to your   
  needs. So, you should not update libraries blindly. I expect you to handle  
  any possible API differences easily. That being said, I'll do my best to keep  
  API stable.
